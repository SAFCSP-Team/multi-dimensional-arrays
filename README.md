# Two Dimentional Array

### Objective
In this project, our main focus will be on understanding two-dimensional arrays, including their declaration, initialization, accessing, and manipulation of elements using indexes.


### Problem
Convert a one-dimensional array `nums` into a two-dimensional array.

### Implementation
Write the implementation of the `convert` method that takes a one-dimensional array `nums` as input, and return a 2D array with a 3x3 dimension.

After calling the method : 
- Print the new 2D array.
- print the element in the third row and second column.

``` java
public class ConverDimensional {
   public static int[][] conver(int[] nums) {
              /*add your code */
   }
  public static void main(String[] args) {
       int[] nums = {2,9,5,3,8,1,4,6,7};
      /*call the method and print array here*/
 }
}
```
